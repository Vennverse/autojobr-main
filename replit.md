## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations. I want iterative development. Ask before making major changes. Focus on AI-powered tools as primary value proposition, with referral network as a unique differentiator.

## System Architecture
The project employs a monolithic architecture, combining the frontend and backend within a single repository.
-   **Frontend**: Built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS for styling, shadcn/ui for components, and Wouter for routing.
-   **Backend**: Developed using Express.js and Node.js.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL, utilizing Drizzle ORM for schema definition and interaction.
-   **Authentication**: Implemented with Passport.js, supporting Google OAuth and local strategies.
-   **AI Integration**: Leverages multiple AI providers including Groq, OpenRouter, OpenAI, and Anthropic for features like resume optimization and cover letter generation.
-   **Payments**: Integrates with Stripe, PayPal, and Razorpay for subscription management.
-   **Email Services**: Uses Resend, SendGrid, and Nodemailer for notifications and communication.
-   **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes WebSockets (`ws`) for features like real-time chat.
-   **UI/UX Decisions**: Employs a modern design approach using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for a consistent and responsive user interface.

-   **System Design Choices**:
    -   Vite dev server operates in middleware mode during development.
    -   Production builds output to a `dist/` directory.
    -   Session storage is handled via PostgreSQL to support multi-instance deployments.
    -   The WebSocket server runs on the same port as the HTTP server.
    -   Replit-specific configurations include running `npm run dev` on port 5000, utilizing Replit PostgreSQL, and being configured for Replit Autoscale deployment.

## Known Technical Debt (October 18, 2025)
**CRITICAL - Requires Future Refactoring:**
- **server/routes.ts God File**: Nearly 8000 lines with 67 LSP errors, duplicate route registrations, and fragile routing order
  - Multiple definitions of same endpoints (e.g., /api/user defined twice at lines 515 and 5234)
  - Duplicate CRM, auth, and other routes causing handler shadowing issues
  - Should be refactored into domain-specific routers (auth, users, jobs, applications, CRM, etc.)
- **Performance Issues**: 
  - No pagination on list endpoints - fetches full result sets causing slow queries as data grows
  - Missing database indexes on frequently queried foreign keys
  - Some endpoints still lack caching
- **Authentication Flow**: 
  - Inconsistent auth middleware - some routes use req.user, others use req.session.user
  - Session fingerprint recovery mode triggered frequently indicating session management issues
  - Frontend makes redundant auth checks before session is fully hydrated
- **Code Quality**:
  - Multiple backup files in server/ directory (routes.ts.backup, routes.ts.original.backup, routes.ts.fixed)
  - Deduplication middleware ineffective due to duplicate route registrations

**Recommendations for Future:**
1. Break server/routes.ts into modular routers by domain
2. Add pagination to all list endpoints
3. Audit and add database indexes for foreign keys
4. Standardize authentication middleware across all routes
5. Clean up backup files and duplicate code
