# AutoJobr Chrome Extension - Multi-Step Form Navigation Guide

## Overview
The AutoJobr Chrome extension now includes comprehensive multi-step form navigation capabilities, allowing users to automatically progress through complex job application forms with intelligent button detection and auto-submission features.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Intelligent Form Detection
- **Multi-Step Recognition**: Automatically detects when forms have multiple steps or pages
- **Platform Support**: Works across LinkedIn, Indeed, Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, and 50+ job platforms
- **Step Indicators**: Recognizes progress bars, step counters, and navigation elements

### 2. Comprehensive Navigation Button Detection
The extension can identify and interact with various navigation elements:

**Next/Continue Buttons:**
- `button[type="submit"]`, `input[type="submit"]`
- Buttons containing "Next", "Continue", "Submit", "Apply", "Send"
- Workday-specific: `[data-automation-id="bottom-navigation-next-button"]`
- Generic patterns: `button[class*="next"]`, `button[id*="submit"]`
- ARIA labeled buttons: `button[aria-label*="continue"]`

**Previous/Back Buttons:**
- Buttons containing "Previous", "Back"
- Navigation links and buttons with back functionality
- Workday-specific: `[data-automation-id*="previous"]`

### 3. Auto-Progression Workflow

```javascript
// Enhanced auto-fill with multi-step progression
async autoProgressForm() {
  let attempts = 0;
  const maxAttempts = 10; // Safety limit
  
  while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
    // 1. Fill current step with comprehensive data
    await this.autoFillCurrentStep();
    
    // 2. Check if form is complete
    if (await this.isFormComplete()) break;
    
    // 3. Navigate to next step
    const navResult = await this.navigateFormStep('next');
    if (!navResult.success) break;
    
    // 4. Wait for page transition
    await this.delay(3000);
    
    attempts++;
  }
}
```

### 4. Smart Field Detection for Current Step
- **Visibility Checking**: Only fills fields that are currently visible and active
- **Viewport Awareness**: Prioritizes fields within the current viewport
- **Active Section Detection**: Focuses on elements in active form sections
- **Hidden Element Avoidance**: Skips fields in `display:none` or `visibility:hidden` sections

### 5. Form Completion Detection
The extension recognizes when forms are complete through:

**Text Patterns:**
- "Thank you", "Application submitted", "Successfully submitted"
- "Confirmation", "Application complete", "Review and submit"

**URL Patterns:**
- URLs containing: "thank-you", "confirmation", "complete", "submitted"

**Element Patterns:**
- `.final-step`, `.confirmation-step`, `[data-step="final"]`
- `.last-step`, `.review-step`

### 6. Safe Button Interaction
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Scrolls buttons into view before clicking
- **Multiple Event Triggers**: Uses mousedown, mouseup, and click events
- **Event Bubbling**: Proper event handling for React/Angular applications
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if clicking fails

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Enable Auto-Progression**: The feature can be enabled in extension settings
2. **Start Auto-Fill**: Click "Auto-Fill Form" button in the extension popup
3. **Monitor Progress**: Extension provides feedback on form progression

### For Developers

await autoFillForm(false); // Fill current step only
```
