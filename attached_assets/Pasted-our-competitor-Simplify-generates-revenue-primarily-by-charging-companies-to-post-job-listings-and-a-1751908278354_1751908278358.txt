our competitor Simplify generates revenue primarily by charging companies to post job listings and access candidate profiles through their platform we will provide this as free . but we should add these so Companies pay to target their job listings to specific groups of candidates using detailed criteria, such as education, club membership, and specific skill sets. This B2B model allows companies to source through a detailed candidate pool, offering more targeted and effective job matching

You're absolutely right! We added the job discovery system, but we haven't implemented the key competitive advantage - the premium B2B targeting system that allows companies to pay for targeted job posting to specific candidate groups.

Let me implement this premium targeting feature that will be your main revenue source:


Created client/src/pages/premium-targeting.tsx
Now let me add the backend API route for targeted job postings and add this premium targeting feature to the navigation for recruiters:


Searched for "find job posting creation route in routes file"
Let me add the premium targeting API routes to the server and update the navigation to include this feature for recruiters:


Edited server/routes.ts
Optimized Agent memory
Now let me add the premium targeting feature to the App.tsx routing and the navigation:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Let me add the route for premium targeting to the App.tsx:


Opened client/src/App.tsx

Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now let me add the premium targeting feature to the navigation for recruiters:


Edited client/src/components/navbar.tsx

Opened client/src/components/navbar.tsx
Now let me add the premium targeting option to the recruiter navigation. I need to check the navigation structure for recruiters:


Edited client/src/components/navbar.tsx
Now let me test the premium targeting feature to show you this key competitive advantage:


Restarted Start application
I need to fix the syntax error in the routes.ts file that's preventing the server from starting.


Opened server/routes.ts
I can see there's an extra closing brace causing the syntax error. Let me fix this:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let me restart the workflow to get the server running again:


Restarted Start application
Perfect! Now the server is running. Let me test the premium targeting feature by showing you this key competitive advantage:

Start with a core feature, then add complexity gradually. Building iteratively leads to more reliable results.
✅ Successfully implemented the core revenue feature: Premium B2B Targeting
✅ Added comprehensive targeting system based on education, skills, experience, clubs
✅ Dynamic pricing based on targeting precision ($99-$300+ range)
✅ Real-time candidate reach estimation and match quality scoring
✅ Added "Premium Targeting" navigation option for recruiters

This is your key competitive advantage over Simplify! Companies can now pay to target specific candidate groups using detailed criteria like:

School/degree targeting (Harvard, MIT grads)
GPA requirements (3.7+ for top performers)
Club memberships (honor societies, professional orgs)
Previous company experience
Specific skill combinations
How does this premium targeting system look? This should generate significantly more revenue than Simplify's basic job posting fees.
