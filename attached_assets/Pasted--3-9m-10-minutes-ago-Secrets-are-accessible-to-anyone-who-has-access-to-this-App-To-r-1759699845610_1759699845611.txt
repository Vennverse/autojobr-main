THE CODE FOR RETAKE WITH PAY IS ALREADY THERE IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEW MOCK AND TEST

15 minutes ago

Show less

Decided on testing strategy (6 seconds)
Got it! Since the retake payment routes are already implemented, let me focus on creating the comprehensive test script to validate the shareable link flow. Let me verify what we have and create the script:


Executed grep -n "retake-payment" server/routes.ts | head -20

Add new ways to manage questions

Check all test connections are working

Check if retakes work for all tests

Planned comprehensive test script creation
Perfect! Now let me create the comprehensive test script to validate the shareable link flow:

NO CHECK IF THEY ARE CORRECTLY SETUP

Created test_shareable_link_flow.mjs

Verified retake route configurations
Understood! Let me check if all the retake routes are correctly set up for virtual, mock, and test interviews:


Decided on frontend retake route fix
I can see the issue! Only the test retake route exists, but the frontend is calling virtual and mock interview retake routes. Let me check what the frontend expects:


Executed rg -C 5 -n '\/api\/interviews\/virtual.*retake|\/api\/interviews\/mock.*retake' client/src

Planned new API endpoint routing
Now I can see the issue! The frontend calls these retake routes but they're MISSING from the backend:

/api/interviews/virtual/:interviewId/retake-payment (POST)
/api/interviews/mock/:sessionId/retake-payment (POST)
Let me add these missing routes:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on remaining tasks
Excellent! I've added the missing retake payment routes for virtual and mock interviews. Now let me run the test script to validate the shareable link flow:


Executed node test_shareable_link_flow.mjs

Diagnosed server response error
The test script is having trouble connecting to the server. Let me check the logs and verify the server is running properly:

Checked console and system logs

Investigated route registration errors
I see the issue! The log shows POST /api/auth/login 404. The login route is returning 404. Let me check if the auth routes are properly set up:


Decided on login route choice
The issue is that /api/auth/login doesn't exist! Let me find the correct auth endpoints:


Executed grep -n "app.post.*auth" server/routes.ts | head -20

Updated auth endpoint configuration
I found the issue! The app uses /api/auth/quick-login instead of /api/auth/login. Let me update the test script:


Decided on database schema correction
Good progress! Authentication worked and we retrieved the link. But there are issues:

DB column name mismatch: job_seeker_id vs jobSeekerId
Server crash when starting interview
Let me check the logs and fix the DB query:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on fixing storage function
Perfect! I found the issue: storage.getInterviewLinkByLinkId is not a function. The route is calling a function that doesn't exist. Let me fix this:


Opened server/routes.ts

Chose direct database query
I need to fix the missing function. Let me replace it with a direct DB query like the GET route does:


Edited server/routes.ts

Planned route property name updates
Good! Now let me check the rest of the route and make sure all property names match the database schema. Let me look at the end of the route to add proper error handling:


Opened server/routes.ts

Decided on schema conversion logic
I need to add proper error handling at the end of the route. Let me find where it ends and add the catch block:


Decided on workflow restart
Excellent! Now let me restart the workflow to load the fixes and run the test again:


Restarted Start application

Decided on test script execution
Good! Let me wait for the server to start and then run the test script:


Executed sleep 5 && node test_shareable_link_flow.mjs
MAKE SURE THE AFTER THE USER CLICKS THE LINK HE GETS ADDED AS APPLICANT TO THE JOB THEN HE GETS ASSIGNED THE INTERVIEW AND THEN REDIRECTED TO TAKE IT

Decided on interview link logic
Understood! Let me check the server logs to see what's failing when starting the interview:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on route error resolution
Perfect! I found the issue. There's a SQL syntax error at line 1582. The problem is we're using camelCase jobSeekerId but the database column is likely using snake_case job_seeker_id. Let me check the schema and fix it:


Executed rg -C 30 -n 'jobPostingApplications.*pgTable' shared/schema.ts

Decided on applicant ID field
I found the issue! The database column is applicantId not jobSeekerId. Let me fix the auto-apply logic in the route:


Chose applicant ID field
Now I can see the issue clearly. The jobPostingApplications table uses applicantId not jobSeekerId, and there's no source column. Let me fix the auto-apply logic:


Decided on schema column name
Perfect! Now let me restart the server and run the test again to verify the complete flow works:


Decided on interview type logic
Excellent! The auto-apply is working! The user was successfully added as an applicant (Application ID: 6). However, the interview assignment didn't happen because:

The redirect URL is /dashboard (default) instead of a specific interview URL
The virtual interview session wasn't created
The problem is the interview type is technical but the switch statement expects virtual. Let me check the server logs and fix this:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on interview routing logic (5 seconds)
Perfect! The auto-apply is working! The log shows: "üéØ Auto-applying user shubhamdubexskd2001@gmail.com to job 112 via interview link"

The issue is that the interview type is technical which doesn't match any case in the switch statement. The interview type should default to virtual for technical/behavioral types. Let me fix this:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on interview type mapping
Excellent! Now let me restart the server and run a final test:


Executed sleep 2 && node test_shareable_link_flow.mjs 2>&1 | tail -40

Fix link sharing: auto-add user to job
Optimized Agent memory

Decided on test file cleanup (5 seconds)
Perfect! The flow is now working correctly! üéâ

COMPLETE WORKING FLOW:

‚úÖ User clicks shareable link
‚úÖ User authenticates
‚úÖ User gets auto-applied to job (Application ID: 6)
‚úÖ Virtual interview gets assigned (Session ID: virtual_assigned_1759699299359_qcmug96jc)
‚úÖ User redirected to interview page: /chat-interview/virtual_assigned_1759699299359_qcmug96jc
‚úÖ Usage count incremented
Let me clean up the test file and update the progress tracker:


Executed rm -f test_shareable_link_flow.mjs
I THINK ISSUE AS WE HAVE VIRTUAL IN THAT THERE IS WE CHOOSE IF WE WANT TO ASIGN TECHNICAL BEHAVIRIOL

Opened .local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md

Decided on virtual interview categorization (4 seconds)
You're absolutely right! I understand now - "virtual" is the category, and within virtual interviews you choose the specific type (technical, behavioral, system design, etc.).

I've already fixed this! The code now:

Stores the specific type (technical, behavioral, etc.) in the database
Maps these types to "virtual" category when processing the link
Passes the actual interview type to create the correct virtual interview assignment
Let me verify it's working by checking the logs:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on interview assignment flow (5 seconds)
Perfect! ‚úÖ It's working correctly now!

The logs confirm the complete flow:

‚úÖ User authenticated
‚úÖ User auto-applied to job (happens in background)
‚úÖ Virtual interview assigned with type "technical"
‚úÖ User redirected to interview: /api/interviews/link/.../start returned 200
‚úÖ Email sent to notify user
The fix correctly handles that:

"Virtual" = the interview category/platform
"Technical/Behavioral/System Design" = the specific interview type within virtual
So when you create a shareable link for a "technical" interview, the system:

Stores interviewType: "technical" in the database
Maps it to the "virtual" category for processing
Creates a virtual interview assignment with interviewType: "technical"
Redirects user to the chat interview page
Let me update the progress tracker:

Update the progress tracking screen
AND VIRTUAL AND CHAT INTERVIEW IS SAME

7 minutes ago

Mapped "chat" to "virtual"
Ah, I understand! Virtual interview = Chat interview. They're the same thing. Let me update the code to also map "chat" to the virtual category:


Opened server/routes.ts

Mapped "chat" to "virtual"
Perfect! Let me add "chat" to the mapping since virtual and chat are the same:


Edited server/routes.ts

Mapped interview types for virtual
‚úÖ Perfect! Updated the mapping.

Now all these interview types are correctly treated as virtual/chat interviews:

technical ‚Üí virtual
behavioral ‚Üí virtual
system_design ‚Üí virtual
coding ‚Üí virtual
chat ‚Üí virtual
virtual ‚Üí virtual
So when you create a shareable link for any of these types, the system will:

‚úÖ Auto-apply the user to the job
‚úÖ Create a virtual interview assignment with the specific type
‚úÖ Redirect to /chat-interview/{sessionId} to take it immediately
The workflow will auto-restart and the changes are live! üöÄ
