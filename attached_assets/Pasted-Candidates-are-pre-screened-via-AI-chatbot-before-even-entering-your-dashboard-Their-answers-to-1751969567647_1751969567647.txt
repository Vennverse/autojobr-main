Candidates are pre-screened via AI chatbot before even entering your dashboard.

Their answers, tone, and clarity go into score.

Recruiters read summary + transcript instead of 100s of resumes.

Implementing **"Why You‚Äôre Not Getting Hired" ‚Äì Post-Application AI Feedback** is an **absolute game-changer** ‚Äî and it can be done efficiently using a mix of **NLP, vector embeddings, and prompt-based reasoning.** Here's exactly how to build it:

---

## üîß STEP-BY-STEP TECH STACK + LOGIC

### ‚úÖ Step 1: **Collect Required Inputs**

* User‚Äôs **resume** (PDF or parsed text)
* **Job Description** they applied to (JD)
* (Optional: Recruiter screening feedback in future)

---

### üß† Step 2: **Preprocess the Resume & JD**

Use a resume parser (like [Affinda](https://www.affinda.com/), [Sovren](https://sovren.com/), or `pyresparser`) to extract:

* Skills
* Education
* Work Experience
* Projects
* Certifications

Then tokenize both resume & JD into:

* Keywords
* Phrases
* Role titles
* Experience level terms

> You can use NLP tools like **spaCy**, **KeyBERT**, or **Hugging Face Transformers**.

---

### üß† Step 3: **Perform Skill & Keyword Matching**

Create two lists:

**From Resume (R):**

```python
['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Keras', 'Flask', 'Intern at TCS', 'B.Tech CS']
```

**From JD (J):**

```python
['Python', 'SQL', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Visualization', 'Bachelor‚Äôs Degree', 'Internship Experience']
```

Then compare:

```python
missing_skills = [j for j in JD_keywords if j not in Resume_keywords]
matched_skills = [r for r in Resume_keywords if r in JD_keywords]
```

---

### üí¨ Step 4: **Generate Natural Language Feedback**

Now feed the matches/mismatches into a **prompt template** to LLM (like GPT or Qwen):

```python
prompt = f"""
Compare this resume with the following job description and explain in simple points:
1. Skills or experience missing in the resume compared to JD
2. Skills that match well
3. Areas where the resume could be improved to match the role better

Resume:
{resume_text}

Job Description:
{jd_text}
"""
```

LLM Output Example:

* ‚ùå ‚ÄúMissing SQL and Tableau, which are core to the JD.‚Äù
* ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ÄúInternship section is weak. Add relevant experience if possible.‚Äù
* ‚úÖ ‚ÄúStrong in Python, ML, and relevant education.‚Äù

---

### üìä Step 5: **Track Pattern Over Time (Per User)**

Store every job application + feedback result in the user‚Äôs history.

> Over time you can show:

* "You're consistently missing SQL in 70% of jobs"
* "Fixing your experience section would improve 50% match rate"

**DB Schema Example (MongoDB or Postgres)**:

```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "job_id": "xyz567",
  "feedback": {
    "missing": ["SQL", "Internship"],
    "match": ["Python", "ML"],
    "advice": "Add internship + SQL project"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T13:15:00"
}
```
