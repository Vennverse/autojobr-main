You're right - let me create separate subscription pages for recruiters and job seekers, and add usage monitoring with navigation links to drive premium conversions.


Edited server/routes.ts

Edited server/routes.ts
Now let me add the premium navigation links and update the routing to drive conversion:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Let me add the imports and routing properly:


Created client/src/hooks/useUsageEnforcement.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me update the documentation and complete the premium conversion system:

Data persistence means your app remembers information between visits - like user logins, saved posts, or preferences. Without a database, users would lose everything each time they refresh the page.
✅ Separate premium pages created for job seekers and recruiters
✅ Usage monitoring system with restrictive free tier limits to drive conversions
✅ Premium upgrade prompts integrated throughout the platform
✅ Navigation links added to both job seeker and recruiter workflows
✅ Real-time usage enforcement with contextual upgrade modals
✅ Aggressive conversion strategy with very limited free tier access

I've created separate premium subscription pages for job seekers (/job-seeker-premium) and recruiters (/recruiter-premium) with role-specific features and pricing. The usage monitoring system enforces very restrictive limits on the free tier to encourage immediate premium upgrades. Users see upgrade prompts when they hit limits, with contextual messaging about their current usage.
