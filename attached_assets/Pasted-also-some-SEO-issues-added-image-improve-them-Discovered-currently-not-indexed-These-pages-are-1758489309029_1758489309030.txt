I can see this is a comprehensive request involving job scraping expansion, enhanced filtering, and SEO improvements. Let me call in our architect to help plan this complex task systematically.
Publish Jobs in a Searchable Way

Jobs must be publicly accessible on your site (no login required to view job details).

Each job should have a dedicated job posting page with:

Job title

Job description

Location (or “remote” if applicable)

Date posted & expiration date

Company name

Job type (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)

✅ 2. Add Job Posting Structured Data (Schema.org)

Google Jobs only works if you use structured data in your job listings.

Use schema.org/JobPosting
.

Example JSON-LD (to put in the <head> of each job page):

<script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context": "https://schema.org/", "@type": "JobPosting", "title": "Software Engineer", "description": "We are looking for a software engineer to join our team...", "datePosted": "2025-09-20", "validThrough": "2025-10-20T23:59", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "AutoJobr", "sameAs": "https://autojobr.com", "logo": "https://autojobr.com/logo.png" }, "jobLocation": { "@type": "Place", "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "123 Main Street", "addressLocality": "Bengaluru", "addressRegion": "KA", "postalCode": "560001", "addressCountry": "IN" } }, "applicantLocationRequirements": { "@type": "Country", "name": "IN" } } </script>
is this true and do we use this thing
