That's a much better approach! You're right - instead of just showing tailored text snippets, we should generate a complete, downloadable PDF resume. Here's why this is better: **Current Issues:** - Users see tailored sections but have to manually copy/paste - High token usage analyzing entire resume - Not a complete end-to-end solution **Your Improved Approach:** âœ… Use existing resume data + user profile as the base âœ… AI only modifies job-specific fields (summary, skills emphasis, experience descriptions) âœ… Generate complete PDF document ready to download âœ… Much lower token usage - targeted modifications only âœ… Better UX - one-click tailored resume **What we'll change:** 1. Keep most resume fields as-is (contact, education, etc.) 2. AI focuses on: - Professional summary tailored to job - Reorder/emphasize relevant skills - Tweak experience descriptions to match job keywords - Maybe adjust achievements to align with job requirements 3. Generate PDF using the existing resume template 4. Provide instant download This is way more practical than showing snippets. Let me create a plan to implement this: I'll create a task list outlining how to build this complete resume generation and PDF download feature. This will use your existing resume data efficiently and provide a much better user experience.
