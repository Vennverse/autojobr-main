The "Invalid hook call" error is still appearing even after clearing the cache. This is a persistent issue. Looking at the browser logs, I can see that the error is repeating multiple times.

The fact that this error persists even after clearing the Vite cache and restarting suggests this is a code-level issue, not a caching issue.

Let me think about what could cause this:

A component is being imported incorrectly
A hook is being called outside a component
There's a circular dependency
Actually, looking at the page, it's completely blank. This suggests the root App component itself might be broken. Let me check the App.tsx file to see if there's an issue with how components are imported or used.

The error persists. This is a code-level issue, not a cache issue. Let me check the root App component to find where the invalid hook call is happening:


Decided on React import strategy (7 seconds)
Let me check how the App component is defined and exported:


Opened client/src/App.tsx

Determined Router component is correct (4 seconds)
Let me check how the App component is exported and how the Router is used:


Checked server logs for access (4 seconds)
Let me check the latest server logs to see if the LinkedIn optimizer API is working now with the fixed authentication:


Executed tail -50 /tmp/logs/Start_application_20251019_041448_870.log | grep -i "linkedin\|auth" || tail -20 /tmp/logs/Start_application_20251019_041448_870.log
$ tail -50 /tmp/logs/Start_application_20251019_041448_870.log | grep -i "linkedin\|auth" || tail -20 /tmp/logs/Start_application_20251019_041448_870.log

Decided on debugging LinkedIn optimizer (7 seconds)
Summary
I've fixed the LinkedIn Optimizer authentication issues:

✅ Fixed
Authentication Middleware - Replaced custom requireAuth with standard isAuthenticated middleware in LinkedIn optimizer routes
Frontend Auth Handling - Fixed the component to properly wait for auth loading state before rendering
Vite Configuration - Removed port conflicts that were preventing the server from starting
Server Status - Server is running successfully on port 5000
⚠️ Current Issue
There's a "Invalid Hook Call" React error preventing the entire frontend from rendering (not just LinkedIn Optimizer). The app shows a blank screen. This error persists even after:

Clearing Vite cache
Restarting the workflow
Verifying no duplicate React versions
