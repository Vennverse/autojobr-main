1. **Estimate flights:** BOM is a major hub. Guess ~400-500 passenger flights and ~30-40 dedicated cargo flights per day.

   - Passenger plane (wide-body): carries ~10-20 tonnes of belly cargo.

   - Assume half the passenger flights are wide-bodies: 225 flights * 15 tonnes/flight = 3,375 tonnes. (This is too high, let''s adjust to 1/4th) -> 110 * 15 = 1,650 tonnes.
