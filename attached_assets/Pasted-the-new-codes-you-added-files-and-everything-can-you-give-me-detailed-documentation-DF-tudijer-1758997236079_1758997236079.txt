Real Execution: Code analysis and testing
Comprehensive Scoring: Technical, project management, and innovation metrics
Project Template Structure
interface ProjectTemplate {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'web_development' | 'data_analysis' | 'mobile_app' | 'api_development';
  difficulty: 'junior' | 'mid' | 'senior' | 'lead';
  estimatedTime: number; // hours
  technologies: string[];
  deliverables: ProjectDeliverable[];
  evaluationCriteria: EvaluationCriteria[];
}
Usage Flow
Recruiter creates skills verification assessment
Candidate receives project brief with requirements
Candidate works on project (days/weeks timeline)
Candidate submits deliverables (code, docs, demo)
AI analyzes all submissions
Comprehensive report generated
2. Personality Assessment Service (personalityAssessmentService.ts)

interface PersonalityAssessmentConfig {
  type: 'big_five' | 'work_styles' | 'comprehensive' | 'leadership' | 'sales_aptitude';
  questionCount: number;
  timeLimit?: number;
  jobRole?: string;
  industry?: string;
}
Question Types
Likert Scale: 1-5 rating questions
Forced Choice: Choose between options
Situational: Scenario-based questions
3. Simulation Assessment Service (simulationAssessmentService.ts)
Purpose
Virtual work environment testing where candidates perform job-like tasks.

Key Features
Virtual Tools: Email, calendar, CRM, ticketing systems, spreadsheets
Realistic Scenarios: Customer service, project management, sales situations
Real-time Tracking: All actions and decisions monitored
Performance Metrics: Time management, accuracy, decision quality
Simulation Tools
interface SimulationTool {
  name: string;
  type: 'email' | 'calendar' | 'chat' | 'spreadsheet' | 'crm' | 'ticketing_system';
  interface: any; // Tool-specific configuration
  permissions: string[];
}
Example Scenarios
Customer Service: Handle support tickets, respond to emails
Project Management: Coordinate team, manage deadlines
Sales: Manage leads, update CRM, schedule meetings
4. Video Interview Service (videoInterviewService.ts)
Purpose
AI-powered video interview analysis with multi-modal evaluation.

Key Features
Video Recording: Secure video capture during interviews
Speech Analysis: Transcription and speech pattern analysis
Facial Expression Analysis: Confidence, engagement detection
Behavioral Metrics: Eye contact, posture, gestures
Content Analysis: Answer quality and relevance
Analysis Components
interface VideoAnalysis {
  transcription: string;
  speechPatterns: {
    pace: number;
    clarity: number;
    confidence: number;
    fillerWords: number;
  };
  visualAnalysis: {
    eyeContact: number;
    facialExpressions: string[];
    posture: string;
    engagement: number;
  };
  contentAnalysis: {
    relevance: number;
    depth: number;
    structure: number;
  };
}
5. AI Detection Service (aiDetectionService.ts)
Purpose
Detect AI-generated responses and potential cheating during assessments.

Key Features
Multi-layered Detection: Pattern analysis, linguistic analysis, behavioral analysis
Cross-validation: Multiple detection methods for accuracy
Confidence Scoring: 0-100% confidence in AI detection
Detailed Indicators: Specific reasons for detection
Detection Methods
Pattern Recognition: Common AI response patterns
Linguistic Analysis: Sentence structure, vocabulary complexity
Behavioral Analysis: Typing patterns, response timing
Cross-validation: Multiple AI models for consensus
6. Behavioral Analyzer (behavioralAnalyzer.ts)
Purpose
Analyze candidate behavior patterns during assessments for authenticity verification.

Key Features
Keystroke Analysis: Typing patterns and rhythm
Mouse Movement Tracking: Natural vs. artificial movement
Navigation Patterns: Tab switching, focus events
Response Timing: Think time vs. typing time
Behavioral Metrics
interface BehavioralProfile {
  typingPattern: TypingPattern;
  mousePattern: MousePattern;
  responseTiming: ResponseTiming[];
  navigationPattern: NavigationPattern;
  overallAuthenticity: number;
  riskAssessment: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
}

How These Systems Work Together
1. Comprehensive Assessment Pipeline
Personality Assessment → Skills Verification → Simulation → Video Interview
2. Security & Proctoring Integration
All systems integrate with proctorService.ts
Behavioral analysis runs during all assessments
AI detection validates all text responses
Multi-modal verification prevents cheating
3. Unified Reporting
Combined scores across all assessment types
