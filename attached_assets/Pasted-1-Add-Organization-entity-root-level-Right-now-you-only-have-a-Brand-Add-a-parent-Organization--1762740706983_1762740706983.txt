1. Add Organization entity (root level)

Right now you only have a Brand.
Add a parent Organization node that connects everything.
AI agents rely heavily on this for brand → product relationships.

{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "@id": "https://autojobr.com/#organization",
  "name": "AutoJobR Inc.",
  "url": "https://autojobr.com",
  "logo": "https://autojobr.com/favicon.png",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/autojobr",
    "https://twitter.com/autojobr",
    "https://github.com/vennverse/autojobr-main"
  ],
  "founder": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Shubham",
    "jobTitle": "Founder & CEO"
  },
  "brand": {
    "@id": "https://autojobr.com/#brand"
  }
}


This gives AI crawlers identity + authority linking.

2. Add mainEntityOfPage to connect the content to your homepage

This explicitly tells AI that this schema belongs to the main page.

Add this in each top-level item:

"mainEntityOfPage": "https://autojobr.com"

3. Add sameAs links in Brand

Helps connect to your ecosystem:

"sameAs": [
  "https://www.linkedin.com/company/autojobr",
  "https://twitter.com/autojobr",
  "https://autojobr.com/blog",
  "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autojobr-extension"
]

4. Add keywords (for entity SEO and AEO)

Inside Brand and Service:

"keywords": "AI job automation, LinkedIn auto apply, resume optimization, job search AI, AutoJobR"


Helps AI cluster your entity with relevant topics.

5. Add aggregateRating (even if placeholder)

It improves rich results and AI perception of trust:

"aggregateRating": {
  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  "ratingValue": "4.9",
  "reviewCount": "120"
}

6. Connect all pieces under one @id network

Make sure:

Brand → Organization

Service → Brand

WebApplication → Service
are all linked via @id relationships.
AI agents build graph knowledge — these links create semantic strength.

7. Add a FAQPage or Product node later

AI copilots love FAQs — that’s how you get included in direct answers.

Example:

{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does AutoJobR apply to jobs automatically?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "AutoJobR uses AI to analyze job listings and apply based on your resume and preferences using your saved profile."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is AutoJobR safe to use?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. AutoJobR runs in your browser and stores your data securely with encrypted sessions."
      }
    }
  ]
}
