üìù Refined Feature Description:
AI Video Interview Practice is a realistic interview simulation where job seekers practice with AI-generated questions that mirror actual interviews‚Äîno theoretical coding challenges, just real-world scenarios. For technical roles, the AI asks practical questions about your experience, problem-solving approach, and asks you to explain code logic/flow verbally (not write running code); your verbal explanation is auto-transcribed to 100-150 words for AI analysis. For non-technical roles, you write your answer and provide a verbal explanation of your thought process. After completing all questions, the AI analyzes your responses, body language, speech patterns, and content quality to deliver comprehensive feedback: "You are capable for this [Role] with strong [specific strengths], but need improvement in [specific areas]" with actionable tips for your next real interview.

üé¨ User Experience Flow:
What happens when you select "Mock Video Interview Practice":

Setup (30 seconds)

Choose your role (e.g., "Frontend Developer" or "Marketing Manager")
Select difficulty level (Entry/Mid/Senior)
Pay $5 (or use credit from bundle)
Interview Begins (15-20 minutes)

Question 1-3: General/Behavioral
"Tell me about a challenging project you worked on"
"How do you handle tight deadlines?"
Record 60-90 second video answer
Question 4-6: Technical (if tech role)
"Explain how you would optimize this database query"
"Walk me through your approach to debugging production issues"
Show code snippet or whiteboard logic
Explain verbally (AI transcribes to 100-150 words)
NO code execution needed - just your thought process
Question 4-6: Domain-specific (if non-tech)
"How would you develop a go-to-market strategy?"
Write brief answer (text box)
Explain verbally your reasoning
AI Analysis (Instant)

Processes your videos + transcripts
Analyzes: content quality, speech clarity, body language, technical accuracy
Detailed Feedback Report

Overall Assessment: "You demonstrate strong capability for Senior Frontend Developer role"
Strengths: "Excellent problem-solving explanation, clear communication, confident body language"
Improvements Needed: "Add more specific metrics when discussing past projects, reduce filler words ('um', 'like'), maintain eye contact"
Recommendation: "Focus on STAR method for behavioral questions, practice explaining complex concepts simply"
‚ú® Key Differentiators:
‚úÖ Realistic questions - What interviewers actually ask, not LeetCode
‚úÖ Verbal logic explanation - For coding, explain your thinking (auto-transcribed)
‚úÖ No code execution pressure - Focus on communication, not syntax
‚úÖ Holistic feedback - Content + delivery + presence
‚úÖ Role-specific - Questions tailored to your target position

This sounds perfect! It bridges the gap between text-based practice and real video interviews. You're testing both what they know (content) and how they communicate (delivery) - exactly what real interviewers evaluate.
