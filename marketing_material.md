- 10% success rate = 1 job offer
- **Time spent:** 40+ hours
- **Cost:** $0 (but opportunity cost is huge)

**With AutoJobr (Smart Saver)**
- 250 applications (5x more with one-click apply)
- 25% callback rate (better resume) = 62 interviews
- 15% success rate (interview prep) = 9 job offers
- **Time spent:** 10 hours
- **Cost:** $156/year (13/mo × 12)
- **ROI:** Securing ONE job 10x faster pays for itself 100x over
