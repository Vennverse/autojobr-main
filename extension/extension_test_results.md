# Chrome Extension Test Results - January 30, 2025

## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Extension Restriction to Job Pages Only
**Issue**: Extension was appearing on all pages with forms instead of just job application pages
**Fix**: Enhanced `isJobApplicationPage()` method with strict detection logic
**Result**: Extension now only appears on actual job posting and application pages

### 2. Server Application Tracking Error
**Issue**: `TypeError: storage.createApplication is not a function`
**Fix**: Updated all references from `storage.createApplication` to `storage.addJobApplication`
**Result**: Application tracking now works without server errors

### 3. Job Saving & Tracking Reliability
**Issue**: Job saving failed when job data extraction was incomplete
**Fix**: Added fallback data extraction from page titles and URLs
**Result**: Job saving and tracking works even on pages with limited job data

## 🎯 Extension Detection Logic

### Strict Job Platform Detection
- ✅ Greenhouse.io, Lever.co, Workday domains
- ✅ ATS platforms (iCIMS, SmartRecruiters, BambooHR, AshbyHQ)
- ✅ Automatic approval for dedicated job platforms

### Major Site Filtering  
- ✅ LinkedIn: Requires `/jobs/` or `/job/` URL patterns + job content
- ✅ Indeed: Requires `viewjob` URL pattern + job content validation
- ✅ Glassdoor: Requires `/job/` URL pattern + job content verification

### Content Validation
- ✅ Job title elements detection
- ✅ Company name elements verification  
- ✅ Job description content checking
- ✅ Application form fields validation
