# AutoJobr Chrome Extension - Workday Fix Guide

## Issue Fixed
The Chrome extension was not able to identify and analyze Workday job pages with client-specific domains like `spgi.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com`.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Domain Support Added
**File: `manifest.json`**
- Added support for all Workday client-specific domains:
  - `*://*.myworkdayjobs.com/*`
  - `*://*.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/*` through `*://*.wd10.myworkdayjobs.com/*`
- Created separate content script section specifically for Workday domains

### 2. Enhanced Selectors
**Files: `smart-detector.js`, `auto-job-analyzer.js`**
- Updated Workday selectors with comprehensive CSS classes:
  - Title: `[data-automation-id="jobPostingHeader"]`, `.css-1id67r3`, `.css-cygeeu h1`, etc.
  - Company: `[data-automation-id="jobPostingCompany"]`, `.css-1t92pv`, `.WDKN_CompanyName`, etc.
  - Description: `[data-automation-id="jobPostingDescription"]`, `.css-1w9q2ls`, `.css-t3xrds`, etc.
  - Location: `[data-automation-id="locations"]`, `.css-129m7dg`, `.WDKN_Location`, etc.

### 3. Platform Detection
**Files: `smart-detector.js`, `auto-job-analyzer.js`**
- Updated platform detection logic:
  ```javascript
  else if (hostname.includes('workday.com') || hostname.includes('myworkdayjobs.com')) platform = 'workday';
  ```

### 4. Dedicated Workday Content Script
**File: `workday-content-script.js` (NEW)**
- Created specialized content script for Workday domains
- Enhanced job detection with multiple fallback selectors
- Visual indicator when jobs are detected
- Real-time job analysis and data extraction
- Observer pattern for dynamic content loading

### 5. Background Script Updates
**File: `background.js`**
- Added handlers for Workday-specific messages:
  - `workdayJobDetected`: Stores job data when detected
  - `openExtensionPopup`: Handles popup requests
- Storage mechanism for latest Workday job data

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Update Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "AutoJobr" extension
3. Click "üîÑ Reload" button
4. Verify version shows 3.1.0

### 2. Test on Workday Job Page
1. Navigate to a Workday job posting like:
   - `https://spgi.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/SPGI_Careers/job/...`
   - Any `*.myworkdayjobs.com` domain
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for page to load
3. Look for floating "AutoJobr: Job Detected!" indicator in top-right
4. Check browser console for detection logs

### 3. Verify Extension Popup
1. Click the AutoJobr extension icon
2. Should show detected job information
3. "AI Job Analysis" button should work
4. "Autofill Application" should be available

### 4. Console Debugging
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
üîß AutoJobr Workday Content Script loaded for: spgi.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com
üîç Initializing Workday job detection
‚úÖ Workday job detected: {title: "...", company: "...", ...}
```

## Key Features Added

### Visual Job Detection
- Floating indicator appears when job is detected
- Shows job title preview
- Auto-hides after 10 seconds
- Clickable to trigger extension popup

### Enhanced Data Extraction
- Multiple selector fallbacks for reliability
- Handles different Workday UI implementations
- Extracts title, company, description, location
- Real-time content monitoring

### Better Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when selectors don't match
- Console logging for debugging
- Storage of job data for popup access

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Detecting Jobs
1. Check if URL contains `myworkdayjobs.com`
2. Wait 3-5 seconds for full page load
3. Refresh the page and try again
4. Check console for error messages

### No Visual Indicator Appearing
1. Ensure you're on a job posting page (not job search results)
2. Check if ad blockers are interfering
3. Try disabling other extensions temporarily

### Popup Shows "Not logged in"
1. Log into AutoJobr platform in another tab first
2. Refresh the Workday job page
3. Click extension icon again

## Files Modified
- `extension/manifest.json` - Added Workday domain support
- `extension/smart-detector.js` - Enhanced selectors and platform detection
- `extension/auto-job-analyzer.js` - Updated selectors and job board detection
- `extension/background.js` - Added Workday message handlers
- `extension/workday-content-script.js` - NEW dedicated Workday script

## Next Steps
The extension should now properly detect and analyze Workday job pages across all client-specific domains. The visual indicator and enhanced selectors ensure reliable job detection even on complex Workday implementations.
