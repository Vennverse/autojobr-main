## Certificate Status: ✅ ACTIVE

**Certificate Details:**
- Domain: autojobr.com, www.autojobr.com
- Type: ECDSA Let's Encrypt Certificate
- Expiry: November 10, 2025 (89 days - NORMAL)

## Why 89 Days is Normal

Let's Encrypt certificates are designed to expire every **90 days**:
- **Security**: Short validity reduces risk from compromised certificates
- **Automation**: Forces regular renewal cycles
- **Industry Standard**: Recommended by security experts

## Verify Auto-Renewal Setup

Run these commands to ensure automatic renewal is working:

```bash
# Check renewal timer status
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer

# Test renewal process (dry run)
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# Check when next renewal will occur
sudo certbot certificates

# View renewal history
sudo cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log | grep renew
```
